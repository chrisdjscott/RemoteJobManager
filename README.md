# Remote Job Manager

Functionality is based on [rjm](https://github.com/mondkaefer/rjm) but using
Globus and FuncX instead of SSH based.

See Getting Started documentation [here](https://chrisdjscott.github.io/RemoteJobManager/getting_started_nesi.html).

And this is some test text added to look at CI/CD :D (TODO remove)
