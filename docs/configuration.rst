Configuration
=============

Use the :code:`rjm_configure` command to configure RemoteJobManager, which will walk
through the configuration options and write the configuration file.

The :code:`rjm_authenticate` command can also be used to make sure you are
authenticated. Tokens will be stored in a file on the local machine so you
should only need to authenticate once.
